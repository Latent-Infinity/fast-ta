=== AUTO-BUILD PROGRESS ===

Project: fast-ta Benchmark Results & PRD Update
Workspace: .auto-claude/specs/002-update-product-requirements-with-benchmark-results
Started: 2024-12-20

Workflow Type: feature
Rationale: Multi-step feature completion - benchmarks are implemented but never executed.
           Task requires: build → benchmark → extract results → update documentation.

Session 1 (Planner):
- Created implementation_plan.json
- Phases: 9
- Total subtasks: 18
- Created init.sh
- Updated project_index.json and context.json

Phase Summary:
1. phase-1-setup: 2 subtasks, no dependencies
   - Build workspace in release mode
   - Verify existing tests pass

2. phase-2-benchmarks: 7 subtasks, depends on phase-1
   - Execute E01 baseline cost benchmarks (7 indicators)
   - Execute E02 RunningStat fusion benchmarks
   - Execute E03 EMA fusion benchmarks
   - Execute E04 rolling extrema benchmarks
   - Execute E05 plan overhead benchmarks
   - Execute E06 memory write pattern benchmarks
   - Execute E07 end-to-end comparison benchmarks

3. phase-3-e01-report: 1 subtask, depends on phase-2
   - Populate E01 REPORT.md with actual results

4. phase-4-e02-e04-reports: 3 subtasks, depends on phase-2
   - Populate E02 REPORT.md with speedups and go/no-go
   - Populate E03 REPORT.md with speedups and go/no-go
   - Populate E04 REPORT.md with speedups and go/no-go

5. phase-5-e05-e06-reports: 2 subtasks, depends on phase-2
   - Populate E05 REPORT.md with break-even analysis
   - Populate E06 REPORT.md with write pattern results

6. phase-6-e07-report: 1 subtask, depends on phase-2
   - Populate E07 REPORT.md with direct vs plan comparison

7. phase-7-summary: 1 subtask, depends on phases 3-6
   - Update docs/experiments/SUMMARY.md

8. phase-8-prd-update: 1 subtask, depends on phase-7
   - Update docs/product-requirements.md Section 1.3

9. phase-9-validation: 3 subtasks, depends on phase-8
   - Verify no TBD values remain
   - Verify tests still pass
   - Verify documentation consistency

Services Involved:
- main: Rust workspace (fast-ta-core, fast-ta-experiments)
  - Role: Execute benchmarks and update documentation

Files to Modify (9):
- benches/experiments/E01_baseline/REPORT.md
- benches/experiments/E02_running_stat/REPORT.md
- benches/experiments/E03_ema_fusion/REPORT.md
- benches/experiments/E04_rolling_extrema/REPORT.md
- benches/experiments/E05_plan_overhead/REPORT.md
- benches/experiments/E06_memory_writes/REPORT.md
- benches/experiments/E07_end_to_end/REPORT.md
- docs/experiments/SUMMARY.md
- docs/product-requirements.md

Parallelism Analysis:
- Max parallel phases: 4 (phases 3, 4, 5, 6 can run in parallel after phase 2)
- Recommended workers: 1 (benchmark execution is the bottleneck)
- Parallel groups: Report population phases can run concurrently

Go/No-Go Decision Targets:
- E02 (RunningStat): ≥20% speedup → Adopt fused kernels
- E03 (EMA Fusion): ≥15% for ≥10 EMAs → Adopt EMA fusion
- E04 (Rolling Extrema): ≥5× at k≥50 → Adopt deque algorithm
- E05 (Plan Overhead): <100 executions break-even → Plan viable
- E06 (Memory Writes): ≥10% improvement → Implement buffering
- E07 (End-to-End): ≥1.5× for ≥20 indicators → Plan mode default

=== STARTUP COMMAND ===

To continue building this spec, run:

  source auto-claude/.venv/bin/activate && python auto-claude/run.py --spec 002 --parallel 1

Manual benchmark execution:

  cd /Users/firestrand/Projects/latenty-infinity/fast-ta
  cargo bench --workspace
