=== AUTO-BUILD PROGRESS ===

Project: fast-ta Micro-Experiments Implementation
Spec Directory: .auto-claude/specs/001-implement-features-from-development-plan-document
Project Directory: /Users/firestrand/Projects/latenty-infinity/fast-ta
Started: 2025-12-20

Workflow Type: feature
Rationale: Greenfield feature development of a Rust technical analysis library with
benchmark-driven validation through 7 micro-experiments (E01-E07). This is a comprehensive
multi-phase project creating new crates, implementing indicators and kernels, and validating
architectural decisions through systematic benchmarking.

Session 1 (Planner):
- Created implementation_plan.json with 6 phases and 26 subtasks
- Created project_index.json for Cargo workspace structure
- Created context.json with file mapping and critical patterns
- Created init.sh for environment setup
- Documented critical dependencies and implementation patterns

Phase Summary:

Phase 0: Foundation & Benchmarking Infrastructure (5 subtasks)
  - Setup: Cargo workspace initialization
  - Dependencies: none
  - Deliverables: Workspace structure, Criterion config, data generators, core traits

Phase 1: Baseline Indicator Implementations (7 subtasks)
  - Implementation: 7 baseline indicators (SMA, EMA, RSI, MACD, ATR, Bollinger, Stochastic)
  - Dependencies: Phase 0
  - Coverage Target: ≥95%

Phase 2: Core Kernel Experiments E01-E04 (7 subtasks)
  - Implementation: RunningStat, EMA fusion, Rolling Extrema kernels
  - Dependencies: Phase 1
  - Deliverables: E01-E04 benchmarks with REPORT.md and go/no-go decisions
  - Coverage Target: ≥90%

Phase 3: Plan Infrastructure Experiments E05-E06 (4 subtasks)
  - Implementation: DAG builder, indicator registry, plan compilation
  - Dependencies: Phase 2
  - Deliverables: E05-E06 benchmarks with break-even analysis
  - Coverage Target: ≥90%

Phase 4: End-to-End Comparison E07 (4 subtasks)
  - Implementation: TA-Lib comparison, direct mode, plan mode
  - Dependencies: Phase 3
  - Deliverables: E07 end-to-end benchmark with final architecture decision

Phase 5: Analysis & PRD Update (2 subtasks)
  - Documentation: Consolidate experiment results, update PRD to v1.5
  - Dependencies: Phase 4
  - Deliverables: SUMMARY.md, PRD v1.5 with validated hypotheses

Services Involved:
  - fast-ta-core: Core library with indicators, kernels, and plan infrastructure
    Path: ./crates/fast-ta-core
    Tech: Rust Edition 2021, MSRV 1.75

  - fast-ta-experiments: Benchmark suite and experiment harness
    Path: ./crates/fast-ta-experiments
    Tech: Criterion.rs v0.5.1

Total Subtasks: 26
Total Files to Create: ~40 new files
Total Files to Modify: 2 (.gitignore, docs/product-requirements.md)

Critical Dependencies:
  - criterion v0.5.1 - benchmarking framework (MUST use harness=false)
  - num-traits v0.2.x - Float trait for generic f32/f64 operations
  - petgraph v0.6.x - DAG construction with topological sort
  - rand - synthetic data generation with seeded RNG

Critical Implementation Patterns:
  - Criterion Benchmarks: MUST use `harness = false` in [[bench]] section
  - Criterion Benchmarks: MUST use `std::hint::black_box()` to prevent dead code elimination
  - Generic Numerics: Use `Float` trait, handle `NumCast::from()` with `.ok_or()`, NEVER `.unwrap()`
  - Petgraph DAG: `toposort()` returns Result - handle cycle detection with `CyclicDependency` error
  - Welford's Algorithm: Numerically stable running mean/variance/stddev
  - Error Handling: All indicators return `Result<T, Error>`

Parallelism Analysis:
  - Max parallel phases: 1
  - Recommended workers: 1
  - Speedup estimate: Sequential execution required
  - Rationale: Strict phase dependencies - each phase builds on previous outputs
    * Phase 1 needs Phase 0 foundation
    * Phase 2 experiments need Phase 1 baseline indicators
    * Phase 3 plan infrastructure needs Phase 2 kernels
    * Phase 4 E07 needs Phase 3 plan
    * Phase 5 documentation needs all experiment data

Verification Strategy:
  - Risk Level: medium
  - Test Types: unit, integration, benchmark
  - Coverage Requirements:
    * Primitives (indicators): ≥95%
    * Kernels: ≥90%
  - Tools: cargo test, cargo tarpaulin, cargo clippy

Quality Gates:
  ✓ All tests pass: cargo test --workspace
  ✓ Coverage targets met: cargo tarpaulin --workspace
  ✓ Zero warnings: cargo clippy --workspace -- -D warnings
  ✓ All benchmarks compile: cargo bench --workspace --no-run
  ✓ All 7 experiment reports exist with go/no-go decisions
  ✓ PRD v1.5 published with validated hypotheses

=== STARTUP COMMAND ===

To continue building this spec, run:

  cd /Users/firestrand/Projects/latenty-infinity/fast-ta
  ./.auto-claude/specs/001-implement-features-from-development-plan-document/init.sh

Or manually:

  cargo build --workspace
  cargo test --workspace
  cargo bench --workspace

For Python orchestrator (when available):

  source auto-claude/.venv/bin/activate
  python auto-claude/run.py --spec 001 --parallel 1

=== NEXT STEPS ===

1. Run init.sh to setup environment
2. Start with Phase 0: Foundation & Benchmarking Infrastructure
3. Complete subtask-0-1: Initialize Cargo workspace
4. Follow implementation_plan.json subtask order
5. Mark subtasks complete in real-time as you work
6. Run verification commands after each subtask
